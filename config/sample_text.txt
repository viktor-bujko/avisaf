Flight XXXX at FL340 in cruise flight; cleared direct to ZZZZZ intersection to join the XXXXX arrival to ZZZ and cleared to cross ZZZZZ1 at FL270. Just after top of descent in VNAV when the throttles powered back for descent a loud bang came from the left side of the aircraft followed by significant airframe vibration. No EICAS messages were observed at this time however a check of the engine synoptic revealed high vibration coming from the Number 2 Engine. I brought the Number 2 Throttle to idle but the vibration continued and severe damage was determined. We ran the severe damage checklist and secured the engine and then requested a slower speed from ATC to lessen the vibration and advised ATC. The slower speed made the vibration acceptable and the flight continued to descend on the arrival via ATC instructions. The FO was dispatched to the main deck to visually survey damage. He returned with pictures of obvious catastrophic damage of the Number 2 Engine and confirmed no visible damage to the leading edge or any other visible portion of the left side of the aircraft. The impending three engine approach; landing and possible go-around were talked about and briefed as well as the possibilities of leading and trailing edge flap malfunctions. A landing on Runway XXC followed and the aircraft was inspected by personnel before proceeding to the gate. After block in; inspection of the Number 2 revealed extensive damage.A mention of the exceptional level of competency and professionalism exhibited by FO [Name1] and FO [Name] is in order; their calm demeanor and practical thinking should be attributed with the safe termination of Flight XXXX!
